        <ol>
        <li><h3>Advertisements</h3>
        <p>The app itself does not display advertisements. However the videos from our embedded YouTube Music player might.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>The Cheer Up Now! app itself does not store or transmit any user data. All calculations and analyses are done locally on the device running the application. This app does not have a backend. So, no user data is relayed back to any backend.</p>

        <p>User faces are accessed through the camera in real time by the app to run inferencing locally on the phone only when the "CLICK ME!" button in the application is pressed, and this data is not stored, retained, or transmitted anywhere, even locally. Therefore, user face data is not shared with any third party whatsoever.</p>
        
        <p>The app contains an embedded YouTube Music player that is only opened if the user clicks the "MUSIC RECOMMENDATIONS" button in the application, and any data that may be collected after that is being collected by YouTube. For more information, go to YouTube's privacy policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</p>

        <li><h3>Social</h3>
        <p>There is no social aspect to this application and no user data is shared with any other users.</p></li>

        <li><h3>APIs and SDKs</h3>
        <p>The APIs and SDKs used in this application do not collect any user data and do not have any age screen.</p></li>
